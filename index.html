        <p> blah blah blah figure this out later</p>

        <h2>The Mission</h2>
        <p>Resilience is a Porn Blocker as well as a movement to help all people take their lives back from pornography addictions.
           By building a community of those willing to improve their lives we can support each other in fighting a system that
           preys on its users and deteriorates the mental health of society. 
        </p>

        <h2> Why</h2>
        <p> Research has shown the strain that pornography has on the minds of developing youth and how it is one of the
            hardest addictions to break. We want people to have control of their lives, because no addiction is a good 
            addiction. 
        </p>

        <h2> How </h2>
        <p> You can use this link to download the chrome extension, and if thats not enough there is an app to help you not 
            give up on being the person you want to be. 
        </p>

        <h2> About the Creator</h2>
        <img src="images/AboutMe.jpg" alt= "About Me" style="float:right" width="140" height="180">
        <p> Ayden Humphries is the creator of Resilience, the apps, and the movement. He has been a porn addict since he was 13 and has been fighting
            to rebuild his life and not let the addiction warp how he sees the world. He spent years looking for a blocker that would prevent him
            from allowing the struggle to win over him and eventually decided to make something that would be strong enough to prevent him from getting around it
            as much as Resilience is for you, it is for him. </p>
